      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>
        Brian's love for sports wagering was fostered at a young age, helping his father with his weekly pick 5 NFL pools.  Eventually, the living room was home to 5 TVs each with its own feed to games across the nation.  For Brian, weekdays were spent researching schedules, tendencies, and injuries while weekends were reserved for watching the games with family; homework always took a back seat to sports.  Today, Brian is bringing his years of picking experience to you, and best of all it is all FREE!
